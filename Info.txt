3rd task:
Write a Swing application, that visualises operation of a simple machine (picture)
The machine consists of two connected lines, where the movement of the first rotates, and the second one's motion depends on the first's
movement and passes through an articulated slider, which limits its movement. If the second line "goes out" of the slider, the application
should notify the user with an error.

The lenght of the first line(l1), the lenght of the second line(l2), the vertical(h) and horizontal(d) distance of the slider from the 
origin of the coordinate system ( p0, where the first line begins) should be parametrized.

On the GUI there should also be a horizontal speed and a vertical speed diagram of p2 point ( the difference between the previous position and
the current position should suffice).

Application should show one whole spin of the simple machine.

Final grade: 3.5 - I didn't write the speed diagrams, and also omitted the error when the line "goes out" of the slider.
